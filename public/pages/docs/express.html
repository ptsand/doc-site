<h3 id="add-dependency">Adding Express to dependencies</h3>
<p>
    To use Express, like any other package,
    you need to add it to your project dependencies in package.json and install it.
    Nodes package manager can do both for you by issuing <code>$ npm install Express</code>
    from any project folder. You could also add it to dependencies by hand and then run
    <code>$ npm install</code>, which will install any missing dependencies listed in package.json.
    That's typically the first thing you would do if you are cloning a node.js based project with git.
    If you want to use npm to install another version than the latest you can do
    <code>$ npm install Express@4.17.2</code> to install version 4.17.2.
</p>

<h3 id="serve-static">Serving static files</h3>
<p>
    Serve files from a folder called public, while handling GET requests to the root,
    using ES modules syntax, like this:
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">import express from "express";
// instantiate express
const app = express();        
// add first middleware function
// (be careful not to expose sensitive information
// like .env files which could contain passwords)
app.use(express.static("public"));
// another middleware function handling GET requests for "/"
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("<h1>Welcome</h1>");
});
// finally listen for incoming connections on port 8080
const server = app.listen(8080);
</code></pre>
<p>
    The middleware function is handling GET requests for the files in the public folder.
    If the requested file is non-existant it is passed on to the next middleware function,
    handling GET requests to the root.
    Finally, if the request is not for the root, the server returns 404 (Not found)
</p>
<p class="mb-1">
    To use express as a commonjs module, replace the first two code statements with
</p>
<code>const app = require('express')();</code>
<p class="mt-3">
    In contrast to ES modules, commonjs modules are dynamically loaded,
    hence you can require and instantiate in one line.

<h3 id="rest-api">REST API</h3>
<p>
    Example of a (partial) REST API for managing dogs:
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">import express from "express";
const app = express();
const dogs = [
    { id: 1, breed: "Bulldog", age: 5 },
    { id: 2, breed: "Great dane", age: 2 },
];

app.use(express.json()); // add middleware to parse json

let currentId = dogs[dogs.length-1].id;

// endpoint to handle put requests
app.put("/api/dogs/:id([0-9]+)", (req, res) => {
    const id = Number(req.params.id);
    // look for the dog in dogs
    const index = dogs.findIndex(dog => dog.id === id);
    if (index !== -1) {
        // existant dog -> update
        dogs[index] = { ...req.body, id: id }; // *
        res.json({message: "dog successfully edited",  data: dogs[index]});
    } else {
        // nonexistant dog -> create
        const dog = { ...req.body, id: ++currentId}; // *
        dogs.push(dog);
        res.status(201).json({message: "Dog successfully created", data: dog});
    }
});
app.listen(8888);
</code></pre>
<p>
    Now put requests can be handled, implementing full CRUD is left as an exercise to the reader.
    The spread operator is used as a concise way to create a new dog object from the request body,
    while it is still not possible to overwrite the <code>id</code> (lines with * comment).
    This is achieved by setting the id AFTER the parameters from <code>req.body</code>. 
</p>
<p>
    Security notice: you should always validate incoming json, which are not done here for simplicity.
    A popular validation package, like for example <a href="https://joi.dev">Joi</a> can help doing that with validation schemas.
